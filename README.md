# AutismBioLearn - AR Biology Tutor
## Team - Potential

Project Future 2.0: IEEE ProjectVoice Hackathon 2023

## Description

This AR application serves as a prototype, showcasing the potential for a fully functional educational tool designed to empower non-speaking autistic students to learn biology at their own pace. It offers an immersive experience, presenting a 3D model of an animal cell with interactive organelles. When a cell component is tapped, the application provides both an audio explanation and a text definition to enhance comprehension. Upon completing the lesson, students can seamlessly transition to a quiz designed to assess their knowledge of cell organelles, ensuring a user-friendly learning experience. Another important feature is a progress tracker that allows the user to estimate how far they are in the quiz.
